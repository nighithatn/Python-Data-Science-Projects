# Python-Data-Science-Projects

This repository contains a collection of **modular Python projects**
focused on building a strong foundation in **Python programming,
data handling, and problem-solving**, with a clear pathway toward
**Data Science and Analytics**.

Each project is structured using **modular programming principles**,
where functionality is separated into individual files and integrated
through a main program.
