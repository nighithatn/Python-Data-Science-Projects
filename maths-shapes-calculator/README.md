# Modular Math Shapes Calculator

This project is a modular Python program developed as an exercise in
structured and reusable coding.

## Problem Statement
Build a modular program to calculate:
1. Area of a Circle  
2. Area of a Rectangle  
3. Area of a Triangle  

Each shape’s calculation is implemented in a **separate Python file**, and a
main file integrates all operations.

## Project Structure
- `circle.py` → Calculates area of a circle  
- `rectangle.py` → Calculates area of a rectangle  
- `triangle.py` → Calculates area of a triangle  
- `main.py` → Integrates all modules and handles user interaction  

## Concepts Used
- Modular programming
- Function definitions
- Python imports
- Basic mathematical operations
- Clean code separation

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
