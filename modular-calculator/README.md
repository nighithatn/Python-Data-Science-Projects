# Modular Calculator in Python

This project is a modular Python program that performs basic
calculator operations using separate modules.

## Problem Statement
Create a calculator program to perform:
1. Addition  
2. Subtraction  
3. Multiplication  
4. Division  

Each operation is implemented in a **separate Python file**, and a
main program integrates all functionalities.

## Project Structure
- `addition.py` → Performs addition  
- `subtraction.py` → Performs subtraction  
- `multiplication.py` → Performs multiplication  
- `division.py` → Performs division  
- `maincalculator.py` → Menu-driven calculator program  

## Concepts Used
- Modular programming
- Python functions
- Conditional logic
- Menu-driven programs
- User input handling

## How to Run
```bash
python maincalculator.py
