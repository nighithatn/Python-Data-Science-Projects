# Modular Calculator in Python

This project is a modular Python program that performs basic
calculator operations using separate modules.

## Problem Statement
Create a calculator program to perform:
1. NumberAddition  
2. NumberSubtraction  
3. NumberMultiplication  
4. NumberDivision  

Each operation is implemented in a **separate Python file**, and a
main program integrates all functionalities.

## Project Structure
- `NumberAddition  .py` → Performs addition  
- `NumberSubtraction.py` → Performs subtraction  
- `NumberMultiplication.py` → Performs multiplication  
- `NumberDivision.py` → Performs division  
- `MainCalculator.py` → Menu-driven calculator program  

## Concepts Used
- Modular programming
- Python functions
- Conditional logic
- Menu-driven programs
- User input handling

## How to Run
```bash
python maincalculator.py
