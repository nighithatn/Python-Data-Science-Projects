# Modular File Operations in Python

This project is a modular Python program designed to perform basic
file analysis operations.

## Problem Statement
Write a modular Python program to:
1. Count the number of words in a text file  
2. Count the number of lines in a text file  
3. Count the number of characters in a text file  

Each operation is implemented in a **separate Python file** and
integrated using a main program.

## Project Structure
- `word_count.py` → Counts number of words in a file  
- `line_count.py` → Counts number of lines in a file  
- `char_count.py` → Counts number of characters in a file  
- `main.py` → Integrates all modules and displays results  
- `sample.txt` → Sample input text file  

## Concepts Used
- Modular programming
- File handling in Python
- Function definitions
- Python imports
- Basic text processing

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
